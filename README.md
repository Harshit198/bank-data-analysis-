   Columns: `account_id`, `customer_id`, `branch_name`, `account_type`, `balance`

3. **transactions** ‚Äî Records transaction details  
   Columns: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `transaction_date`, `transaction_type`, `amount`

4. **loans** ‚Äî Contains loan-related data  
   Columns: `loan_id`, `customer_id`, `loan_type`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, `tenure_years`, `default_status`

## üß† SQL Operations Performed

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Table Creation & Data Import**
- Created all tables using proper datatypes and foreign key constraints.
- Imported CSV files into MySQL using:
  ```sql
  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/customers.csv'
  INTO TABLE bank_analytics.customers
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' 
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
  IGNORE 1 ROWS;
